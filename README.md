# Animated Bubble Maps - Data Visualization with Plotly
A simple animated bubble chart showing the GDP of countries. 

## Overview
Animated Bubble Maps is a data visualization project that showcases the power of Plotly for creating dynamic and interactive geospatial visualizations. The project demonstrates how to create an animated bubble map to visualize inflation-adjusted GDP Per Capita (USD) by country over time. The project leverages Plotly's extensive capabilities to offer an immersive user experience and deeper insights into geospatial data.

## Features
- **Improved Data Exploration**: Users can zoom in, zoom out, and pan across the map, enabling them to explore detailed geographic information effortlessly. This level of interactivity enhances data exploration and analysis by providing a broader context for the presented data.

- **User Engagement**: Animated maps captivate audiences with interactive features. Users can click on specific points and obtain additional information, making the experience more dynamic and enjoyable.

- **Customized Data Views**: Empower users with control. Animated maps allow customization based on specific criteria. Filters, data layers, and visualizing specific data points enable users to focus on particular aspects of the data.

- **Enhanced Insights and Patterns Identification**: Animated maps bring data to life, helping users identify patterns, trends, and relationships that might be elusive in traditional charts or tables. Spatial correlations and variations become clearer when data is visually represented geographically.

- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Stay up-to-date with the latest information as it unfolds, as animated maps can display real-time or near-real-time data.

- **Geospatial Analysis**: Animated maps open the doors to geospatial analysis, where users can perform calculations, measure distances, draw regions of interest, and conduct other geographical operations to gain deeper insights from the data.

- **Storytelling and Presentations**: Leverage animated maps in websites, reports, or presentations to create compelling narratives. Communicate complex information effectively and keep audiences engaged through data-driven stories.

- **Accessibility and Sharing**: Easily share animated maps online, fostering stakeholder collaboration and data sharing. The interactive nature ensures seamless knowledge transfer.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The versatility of animated map libraries, like Plotly, allows users to view and interact with maps on various devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones.

## How to Use
Install Dependencies: Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```pip install plotly pandas```

1. Prepare the Data: Clean your data and correctly format all numbers. Ensure you have a CSV file containing the GDP data for each country over multiple years. The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gwenaelmouthuy/gdp-per-capita-between-1960-and-2021
2. Data Processing and Visualization: Follow the step-by-step process in the Jupyter notebook provided to transpose the data, create the animated bubble map, and generate a color key chart.
3. Interact and Explore: Run the notebook to visualize and interact with the animated bubble map. Play the animation, zoom in, and hover over the bubbles to explore the data dynamically.
